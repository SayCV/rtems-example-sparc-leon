This is a demo application for one or multiple GR-RASTA-ADCDAC PCI targets. The 
demo can be compiled for thee different systems:
 ¤ AT697         (rtems-rasta-adcdac-leon2)
 ¤ LEON3         (rtems-rasta-adcdac-leon3)
 ¤ LEON2 GRLIB   (rtems-rasta-adcdac-leon2grlib)

Two different PCI Host controllers are supported and autodetected for LEON2-GRLIB
and LEON3 systems.

The sample application can be configured from defines in rtems-rasta-adcdac.c 
to use the GRADCDAC, GPIO and GRETH cores on the Target Board(s). The GRCAN driver
is loaded but not used, a sample application is available in rtems.grcan.c.
