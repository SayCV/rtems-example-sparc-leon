NOTE: The paranoia program may report errors when executed on tsim
on intel hosts. This is due to a bug in paranoia - not the compiler.

Some hints:

* rtems-cdtest is a C++ application that tests exception handling. If you
  run it on leon hardware using dsumon, remember to start dsumon with -nb
  to stop dsumon from breaking on forced exceptions.

* rtems-ttcp is a network test program and needs a lot of memory for 
  network buffers. If you run it on the GR-PCI-XC2V board through the
  dsumon, start dsumon with -nosram to use the 16 (or 64) Mbyte of
  sdram rather than the 1 Mbyte of sram.

* rtems-http is a web server demo program. It also includes an
  ftp server and allows uploading and downloading of files.

* rtems-shell is an demonstraion program for the RTEMS shell.
  Type help at the prompt to see the available commands.

* config.c Configure driver resources, initializes the Driver Manager
  and BSP Networking Stack.
